# Gui Classification 

This project uses the `guizero` module to create a GUI application that classifies images using OpenVINO. To install OpenVINO, follow this updated [guide](https://gist.github.com/sentairanger/caf11a2432ceebd715c6b33c224f4960). Also be sure to have the NCS2 inserted into the Pi before running the code.

## Getting started

After installing OpenVINO be sure to test things first and then run the code with `python3 gui-classification.py`. Note that this has been tested on a Pi 4 with Bullseye 64 Bit. I will be running tests on Bookworm 64 Bit and update if necessary. Once I get my hands on a Pi 5 I will test as well.
